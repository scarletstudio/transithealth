# Makefiles

`Make` is a tool that helps engineers and researchers specify how to create certain files. It is handy for mapping out data dependencies, creating reproducible results, and automating simple tasks. We write a `Makefile` to organize all the steps in our offline pipeline.

## Reading Makefiles

Each part of a `Makefile` has three parts:

- **Target:** the file path of the object to make.
- **Dependencies:** the targets that we must make before this one.
- **Commands:** the commands to run to make this target.

Steps in `make` look like this:

```make
TARGET_NAME: DEPENDENCY_TARGET_NAME_1 DEPENDENCY_TARGET_NAME_2 DEPENDENCY_TARGET_NAME_3
    COMMAND_1
    COMMAND_2 --flag_1="command with CLI flags"
    COMMAND_2 \
        --flag_1="command split over multiple lines with backslashes" \
        --flag_2="another option"
    COMMAND_4
```

Here is an example from our offline pipeline:

```make
data/transformed/rideshare.csv: data/extracted/daily_rideshare.csv
    python3 transform/daily_rideshare.py \
        --input_file="data/extracted/daily_rideshare.csv" \
        --output_file="data/transformed/rideshare.csv"
```

There can also be **phony targets**, where the target does not match any file name that gets created. These become like scripts we can run. One of the `make` commands you will run often is a phony target:

```bash
make reload
```

## Running Makefiles

You can run a `make` command like this:

```bash
make TARGET_NAME
```

If `TARGET_NAME` has not been created, `make` will find all of its dependency targets recursively and run them to make it. If any of the target's dependencies have changed since this target file was last edited, then `make` will also update the current target.

If `TARGET_NAME` hasÂ already been created, `make` will tell you there is nothing to be done:

```bash
make: `TARGET_NAME` is up to date.
```

## Writing Makefiles

To add a step, make sure you specify [all three parts](#reading-makefiles).

If one `make` step becomes too complicated, think about breaking it up into multiple steps with dependencies.

Read comments in the `Makefile` to understand which steps are organized together.

You can also put variables in your `Makefile` like this:

```bash
# This variable can be used in the Makefile
PORTAL_RIDESHARES := https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/m6dm-c72p.json
# This variable can be used in the Makefile and read as an environment variable by commands
export CHICAGO_HEALTH_ATLAS_API=https://api.chicagohealthatlas.org/api/v1
```

In your `Makefile` steps, you can insert a variable like this:

```make
data/extracted/daily_rideshare.csv:
    python3 extract/from_data_portal.py \
        --json_url="$(PORTAL_RIDESHARES)" \
        --soql_file="extract/daily_rideshare.sql" \
        --output_file="data/extracted/daily_rideshare.csv"
```

In your Python code, you can access an environment variable like this:

```python
import os

API = os.environ.get("CHICAGO_HEALTH_ATLAS_API")
```
