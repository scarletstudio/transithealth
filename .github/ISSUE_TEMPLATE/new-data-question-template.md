**Data Question Topic:** ? (or a tentative topic if you are still deciding)

Write a one-sentence description here for what your data question will help visitors learn about.

- Why do visitors want to know about this topic?
- What are some limitations of the data to keep in mind?
- What views do you want to use to present the data? (Visualizations, tables, text, videos, audio?)
- Is additional work on the backend API and offline pipeline necessary to support this question?

Read the documentation on how to add a new data question:

- [Short Guide](https://github.com/scarletstudio/transithealth/blob/main/docs/pages/tasks.md#add-a-component)
- [Full Guide](https://github.com/scarletstudio/transithealth/blob/main/docs/pages/new_question.md)

This task is more open-ended and will involve two or more pull requests:

- [ ] Create initial question page (add site entry and component)
- [ ] Continue adding to your question page until it is ready to launch
